# Lazybot
Cusehacks 2020 project by: Maxwell Bockmann, Joshua Park, Tim Kilmer, Lucio Chen, Dounglan Cheung

Lazybot is a bot that takes images as an input and uses a facial recognition API to place lazers on the eyes then deep fry the image.
Lazybot is based on Reddit and can be called to a post or comment by typing "/u/lazer_eye_bot" or "/u/lazer_eye_bot [image url]".

We use the following packages/libraries:

--> PRAW for reddit

--> OpenCV for facial recognition

--> PIL for image processing

--> Requests HTTP Library to get the URLs

--> Random standard library

--> Time standard library

--> Re standard library

--> Imgur API for posting images on Imgur
